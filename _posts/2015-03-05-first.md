The begining  of all things
===================
Hi! I am Ícaro Abreu, a padawan with a terrible habit of never feel satisfied with it's current abilities, knowledge and lifestyle. I tend to continue to push the line of satisfaction to continue to grow and evolve more and more.

###Who am I:

 - Android and Web developer who likes to play with Game Development
 - Lasagna freak
 - Challenge driven person
 - I like to know and bond to many people as possible (
   because I find them really interesting, I will explain deeply in another post)
 - I like GURPS **judge me!**
 - Star Trek made a bigger impact in my life than Star Wars... I am sorry, I do...
 - I play games more for the mechanics than history 
 - **Don't give me puzzles! I have to eat!**
 - Tarantino made my favorite movies of all times (so far, amuse me!)
 - Music plays a major part of who I am
 - Etc........

I made this blog with the intent to talk about everything that I care enough to write about!

 > But mainly to write about my life as a developer and his journey to madness and crazyness.

May the force be with us, so that we have a long and prosper life!
